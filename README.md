# haesteinnbattleroyale
This is a save file in which many of Koifish's most legendary Haesteinns from videos are added into one save file. 
The custom kingdoms/empires were created using the Entitled mod, but that should not be necessary to run the save. The Asia Expansion mod is necessary, since one of the Haesteinns is in China. No other mods were used.
All Haesteinns start as rivals to the base-game Haesteinn and with an ample supply of gold, prestige, and piety, in order to make the save challenging for the player when using Haesteinn.
